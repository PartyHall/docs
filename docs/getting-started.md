# What's PartyHall ?

PartyHall is a set of software that lets you build an appliance to be used at your parties. It aims at enhancing events by providing a photobooth and multiple games to be played (Karaoke, Quiz, Blind-test, etc...)

The project regroups the following:
- Detailed instructions on how to build your appliance on the hardware side
- PartyHall, the software that runs on the appliance and does the bulk of the work
- PartyNexus, a companion server app that lets everything synchronize on your server, and let your friend easily access everything related to the given event.
- Kraftok√©, an upcoming all-in-one software to build karaoke songs for the appliance. Even though it's tailored for PartyHall, it can be used outside of the project.

### Building an appliance

The hardware side of things is not fully determined yet.

For the past four years, I've been using a custom made wooden box with an old i5-3550 in it, alongside with a screen and a webcam.

Once the plans are made, they will be available in a specific section of the documentation.

### Getting started

First we'll setup PartyNexus so that you have a hub for synchronizing everything, then we'll deploy PartyHall on an appliance. Building a full appliance is not strictly required, but you will need at least a computer with a hard-drive ready to be formatted, a webcam and an ESP32 for the physical buttons.

The pages on the left-hand side bar are ordered properly, it is expected that you read them in the order they are displayed, unless stated otherwise by the page you are reading.

This is especially important for the setup steps.
