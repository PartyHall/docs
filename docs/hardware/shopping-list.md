# Shopping list

## Recommanded hardware

Here's what I use for my own appliance, which is the best-case supported scenario

### Tools used

Here are the tools used to build this. You do not NEED everything and you are more-than-encouraged to check out in your area to find a fablab / hackerspace since they most likely have everything

- Soldering station + tin
- Laser cutter / CNC machine (Everything can be hand-cut but it will be cleaner and easier)
- Label printer
- Drill
- 3d printer

### Expected to have

Those are the stuff I do not recommend a specific thing but you are expected to provide any you want

- Power supply unit (If you want to go fancy, a modular one will let you have much needed free space in the case)
- A m2 SSD (Size depending on your karaoke / song collection, m2 is recommended to save on space in the case)
- Small wires to connect the ESP32 (I use [these](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0C7TJG9YB) ones)
- Less-small wires to connect the power to the screen and the ledstrip
- Screw terminal (idk what's their real name, we call them "Domino" in french [like those](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B087B57Y9X))
- A 1080p 16:9 webcam - OR - a camera (that can be detected as a webcam in Firefox)

### Still missing in the list above & below

I don't know exactly those stuff yet

- Wood
- Plexiglass (Screen protector)
- The mecanism for the back door lock
- The mecanism to collapse the button panel
- The thing to hold the webcam
- Audio interface for the karaoke
