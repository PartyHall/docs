# Getting started

The hardware can differ wildly, and you are free to do anyhow you want depending on the stuff you have laying around, or the tools / budget you have.

This is how I built my appliance but do not hesitate to improve on it.

Something to note is that not everything is required:
- Webcam is, obviously, required
- Audio interface can be skipped if you do not use the karaoke feature
- The whole buzzers building can be skipped if you're not using the Quiz / Blind test feature or virtual buzzers are enough for you.


The strict minimal requirements is:
- A computer (PSU, Mother board, CPU, RAM, SSD)
- A Webcam
- An ESP32
- Physical momentary switch to be wired to the ESP32
